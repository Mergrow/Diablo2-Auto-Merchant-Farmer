# Diablo2-Auto-Merchant-Farmer


Use the old merchant glitch to auto farm gold.

## How the glitch woks
More atributes that you items have, more expensive they are.
So the glitch consists on getting a item with "To maximum damage (based on character level)", this way when the item is equipped the merchant will pay the price based on your character level.
When you rebuy it, it will be cheaper, because it gets the lowest level on merchant inventory.


## How to use it

- The game needs to be in legacy mode, default Key is [G].
- The game needs to be fullscreen and set to 800x600 resolution in legacy mode.

To use the glitch:

1. Download Python 3 and download the script source folder.
2. Run in console inside the downloaded folder: "pip install -r requirements.txt".
3. Open the game, switch it to legacy mode, go to the merchant store, open the trade menu, and navigate to the weapon tab.
4. Ensure there is enough space on the tab for the sold item to go to.
5. Equip the item with level-based maximum damage on the main hand and Sell it.
6. Now run the script and position the cursor on the sold item frame in the merchant inventory.
7. It should start to buy it and re-sell.

To stop the script, just press the ESC button.
